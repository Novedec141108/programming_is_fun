## Installing software for the class
We will use [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) for the first part of our programming course.
This is a very easy piece of software for learning Python
Just download it for [Windows](https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases/download/v3.2.7/thonny-3.2.7.exe) or 
[Mac OS X](https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases/download/v3.2.7/thonny-3.2.7.pkg), and follow the instructions
for installation.


In the second part of the course, we will start using proper text editors and git-bash,
along with a proper python distribution.
